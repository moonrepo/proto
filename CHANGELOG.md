## Unreleased

#### 💥 Breaking

- Reworked how backends (asdf, etc) are configured. Instead of being prefixed on the version, they are now on the tool identifier. Example: `zig = "asdf:0.14"` -> `"asdf:zig" = "0.14"`
  - Unfortunately, there was no simple way to support both patterns in parallel, so this is a hard break.
  - This opens the door for new functionality in the future, and also makes more logical sense.
- Removed the `[tools.*.backend]` setting, as it doesn't work with this new pattern.
- **WASM API**
  - Renamed `ToolContext` to `PluginContext`.
  - Renamed `ToolUnresolvedContext` to `PluginUnresolvedContext`.

## 0.51.6

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added unstable support for bubbling up logs from WASM plugins (when applicable).
- Improved argument quoting for child processes to be based on the current shell.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated Rust to v1.89.0.
- Updated dependencies.

## 0.51.5

#### 🚀 Updates

- Improved `registry://` fallthrough handling.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where auto-clean would delete a tool, but our "last used" logic would leave around stale artifacts, resulting in missing tool/executable errors.
- Fixed an issue where activated tools would not track a last used at, and could be accidentally deleted by auto-clean.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.51.4

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `proto install <tool> <req>` would resolve to a version from the local manifest, instead of remote available versions.
- Fixed an issue that would cache remote versions for a tool when there were none available (network issue, etc).

#### ⚙️ Internal

## 0.51.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue with build from source flows that would not attempt to auto-install system dependencies in CI.

## 0.51.2

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue what would cause an "unknown field `spec`" error within moon when there were conflicting proto versions.
  - Tools that were installed with proto 0.51.x before this patch will have a broken manifest. You'll need to manually modify the manifest and remove the `spec` and `version` fields within the `lock` entry, or force re-install the tool.

## 0.51.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a GLIBC version not found error. We built on Ubuntu v24 instead of v22 by accident (oops).

## 0.51.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- Removed `--canary` from `proto install`, just use `canary` as the version specifier instead.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added unstable lockfile support through a `.protolock` file.
  - Can be enabled per-project with the new `settings.unstable-lockfile` setting.
  - This feature is still a work in progress and hasn't been fully implemented yet.
  - Updated `proto install` to support lockfiles.
    - Versions will be inherited from the lockfile if there's a matching specification record.
    - Checksums of downloaded tools are stored and validated in the lockfile.
    - Added an `--update-lockfile` flag, which will bypass the lockfile record.
  - Updated `proto uninstall` to support lockfiles.
    - Will remove any matching record from the lockfile.
- Added unstable support for OCI registries as a plugin storage mechanism.
  - Added a new `registry://` locator: `registry://ghcr.io/org/plugin`.
  - Plugins are stored as a layer/artifact within the OCI image.
  - Supports all plugin formats, WASM, TOML, JSON, and YAML.
  - Can customize registries with the new `settings.unstable-registries` setting.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.50.5

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `proto activate` would remove manually inserted `~/.proto` paths.

## 0.50.4

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added timing information to plugin process executions and network requests.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where installing multiple tools would fail when one of the tools is building from source and attempts to install system dependencies. For now when installing multiple tools, system dependencies will not be installed and the build assumes they exist.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.50.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue with `proto activate` that would generate invalid Fish syntax.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

- Fixed an issue with `proto activate` where `[env]` variables would sometimes not be set.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated Rust to v1.88.0.
- Updated dependencies.

## 0.50.1

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a `cache-duration` setting and `PROTO_CACHE_DURATION` environment variable, to control how long plugins are cached for (in seconds).
- Updated Windows shell to use `powershell.exe` if `pwsh.exe` is not available.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `schema_tool` to v0.17.4.
  - Added `metadata.default-version` and `metadata.plugin-version` fields.

## 0.50.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- Updated `proto install <tool>` (without version) to install a version pinned in `.prototools`, instead of the latest version. If you want to install the latest version, you can use `proto install <tool> latest`.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Comments are now preserved when updating TOML config files (`.prototools`, etc).
- Commands executed from WASM plugins will now always run within a shell.
  - Added a `PROTO_SHELL` environment variable that can be set to define which shell to use, otherwise defaults to the current process shell.
- Added environment variable support to many non-tool related `.prototools` settings.
- Added a new `settings.url-rewrites` setting that allows you to rewrite URLs using regex patterns.
  - This is useful if you have an internal mirror or proxy that you want to use.
- Updated the `proto activate` command:
  - Will now run the initialization hook immediately, instead of waiting for a directory change. Because of this, the `--on-init` option has been deprecated.
  - Added a new `--no-init` option that will skip the initialization hook. This will function like it did previously.
- Updated the `proto bin` command:
  - Added a new `--dir` option that will print a directory instead of a file. Supports the value "exes" or "globals".
  - Added a new `--all` option that will print all paths, instead of just the first.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where plugins that provide a checksum directly, instead of a URL, would fail to verify the checksum correctly.
- Fixed an issue with the asdf backend where a plugin expects the checkout folder to have a specific name.
- Fixed some path normalization issues on Windows.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `asdf_backend` to v0.3.
  - Updated the backend ID/path to `asdf/<tool>` instead of `asdf-<tool>`.
  - Updated scripts to extract the command/shell to execute with from its shebang.

- Updated `node_tool` to v0.17.
  - Added support for `volta.extends` when detecting a version.
- Updated `node_depman_tool` to v0.16.
  - Improved `package.json` parsing.
- Updated `python_uv_tool` to v0.3.
  - Added detection sources: `uv.toml`, `pyproject.toml`

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.49.5

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a global `--log-file` option (and `PROTO_LOG_FILE` environment variable) that will write all logs to a file.
  - This is useful for debugging issues that are hard to reproduce, or when you want to keep a log of the commands ran.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.49.4

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated `proto run` (and shims) to fallback and run a global executable on `PATH` of the same name if a version was not configured and detected.
  - This change aims to mitigate a situation where the `~/.proto/shims` file takes precedence on `PATH` but proto should not be used.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed some shell quoting/escaping issues on Bash/Zsh.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.
- Updated wasmtime to v30 (from v29).

## 0.49.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed some Nushell issues for the `proto activate` flow.
  - You'll need to regenerate the module: `(proto activate nu) | save ~/.config/nushell/proto-hook.nu`

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated Rust to v1.87.0.
- Updated dependencies.

## 0.49.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a regression with virtual paths that broke path composition.
  - This primarily affects the `rust` tool.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.49.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a new RFC for lockfiles: https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/issues/779
- Updated `proto activate` to no longer take a snapshot of `PATH` that can become stale.
- Updated multi `proto install` to write a markdown compatible error log when a tool fails to install.

## 0.48.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added internal lockfile records that will validate against checksums for authenticity.
  - Records are stored for each tool in their inventory manifest: `~/.proto/tools/<name>/manifest.json`
  - This is not retroactive and will only apply to installed tools going forward.
- Added a new Ctrl+C handler on Windows for shims, that should pass the signal down to the
  underlying executable, instead of being captured in the shim. This is based on Cargo's implementation.
- Added support for SHA512 checksums.
- Added support for Windows checksum files generated with `Get-FileHash`.
- Updated `proto install <tool>` to detect a version from the current directory if a version is not provided.

- Updated Rust to v1.86.0.
- Updated dependencies.

## 0.47.8

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where progress bars were rendering incorrectly.

## 0.47.7

#### 💥 Breaking

- Reverted the ability for proto to shim itself, and in turn the ability to pin the proto version.
  - This was causing large process trees, where proto would recursivelay call itself, and eating up a lot of resources.
  - We automatically attempt to remove the old shims, but if you run into any weirdness, you may need to manually remove `~/.proto/shims/proto` and `~/.proto/shims/proto-shim`.
  - We'll revisit this feature in a future release.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.47.6

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.47.5

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a way for plugins to prepend arguments for parent executable based commands.
- WASM API
  - Added `ExecutableConfig.parent_exe_args`.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `proto upgrade` would fail when the `proto` shim is intercepting the execution.
- Fixed an issue where the `load_versions` WASM call would fail for plugins with an older PDK version.

## 0.47.4

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated `proto run` (and shims) to not error with "not a built-in plugin" when the executable exists globally on `PATH`, but is currently not configured/managed by proto in the working directory.
  - This error can occur when a `~/.proto/shims` file exists for a tool, but the version/plugin is not configured.
  - This should make interoperability a little bit nicer.
- Reduced the amount of `locate_executables` calls for certain flows when linking binaries.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `proto activate` would load more plugins than necessary, causing a performance hit.
- Fixed an issue during `--build` where the system package manager would error attempting to load existing packages.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.47.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Removed the global pinning that is triggered during `proto upgrade`. This fixes a weird edge case that puts your store in a broken state. This change won't be noticeable until after you upgrade to this version.

## 0.47.2

#### 🚀 Updates

- Improved the asdf backend integration.
- WASM API
  - Added a new `ToolUnresolvedContext` type to better differentiate what values are actually available during certain operations.
  - Added `BuildInstructionsInput.install_dir` and `LocateExecutablesInput.install_dir` field.
  - Added `RunHookResult.paths` field.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `asdf_backend` to v0.2.
  - Added `exec-env` experimental script support. Runs as a `pre-run` hook to extract any set environment variables.
  - Added `latest-stable` script support when the alias "stable" is used for a version.
  - Reduced the amount of calls made for converting `/proto/backends` virtual paths into a real path.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `proto plugin` sub-commands wouldn't work correctly with backend related tools.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.47.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed the version backend being lost when pinning via `proto install --pin`.
- Fixed some issues with `proto regen` that require a resolved version to function correctly.
- Fixed the backend repository being `git` pulled too often.
- Fixed backend related shims failing with a no executable found error.

## 0.47.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- WASM API
  - Deprecated `LocateExecutablesOutput.exes_dir` field.
  - Removed `LocateExecutablesOutput.primary`, and `secondary` fields.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a new plugin type, `backend`, that allows us to use plugins from 3rd-party version/package managers, with initial support for [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) (Unix only).
  - To enable, prefix the version with `asdf:`, for example:
    ```
    act = "asdf:0.2"
    ```
  - Or set the new `backend` tool setting.
    ```
    [tools.act]
    backend = "asdf"
    ```
  - The asdf repository will be cloned into `~/.proto/backends`, and the scripts provided will be executed on-demand.
  - Currently does not support the `exec-env` script, which may be required for certain tools.
  - Thanks to @LorenzoBloedow for the contribution!
- Added a new built-in tool: `poetry` (Python)
- Added shim support to the internal `proto` tool, allowing the proto version to be pinned in `.prototools`, and the version to dynamically be detected at runtime. This enables a specific proto version to be used per project.
- Updated `proto install` to now install proto if a version has been defined.
- Updated offline connection checks to also ping IPv6 addresses for Google & CloudFlare DNS.
  - Added a `PROTO_OFFLINE_IP_VERSION` to control which version to only check against.
- WASM API
  - Added `DownloadPrebuiltOutput.checksum` field.
  - Added `DetectVersionInput` struct.
  - Added `LocateExecutablesOutput.exes_dirs` field.
  - Added `ParseVersionFileInput.context` field.

- WASM API
  - Removed deprecated `fetch`, `fetch_url`, `fetch_url_bytes`, `fetch_url_text`, and `fetch_url_with_cache` helper functions. Use the newer fetch functions instead.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added `$XDG_DATA_HOME` support when detecting the proto store. Will be used if `$PROTO_HOME` is not set, and will fallback to `$HOME/.proto`.
- Added `settings.build` configuration, allowing aspects of the build from source process to be customized.
- Updated `proto install` to log checkpoints instead of rendering progress bars in a non-TTY environment.
- Updated `proto install` to support build from source when installing multiple tools.
  - If the build fails, a markdown compatible log file will be written to the current directory.
- Disabled HTTP request caching when in a Docker container.
- Improved our errors implementation, rewriting some error messages, and updating error codes.
- Started on a new "backend" plugin system, allowing third-party tools to be used as proto plugins.
  - For example, asdf on Unix, and scoop on Windows. This will land in the next release.
- WASM API
  - Added `BuildInstruction::RemoveAllExcept` variant.
  - Added `register_backend` plugin function.
  - Added `fetch`, `exec`, `exec_captured`, `exec_streamed`, `get_host_env_var`, `set_host_env_var`, `add_host_paths`, `into_real_path`, and `into_virtual_path` helper functions.
  - Added `generate_build_install_tests!` test macro.
  - Renamed `ToolMetadataInput` to `RegisterToolInput`.
  - Renamed `ToolMetadataOutput` to `RegisterToolOutput`.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.45.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where generating all the `~/.proto/bin` files for a tool may result in missing file warnings.
  - Previously, we assumed that the exe locations from the resolved version would apply to all the versions being linked, but this isn't always true and isn't backwards compatible.
  - We've now updated the bin linking to make a WASM API call for _each_ version being linked when locating exes, in hopes that this now finds the correct locations.
- Fixed some directory unlocking issues.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `python_tool` to v0.13.1.
  - Improved logic that detects legacy installs.

- Updated `proto install`, `proto outdated`, and `proto status` to respect the `settings.detect-strategy` setting.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where cached versions may be written to the wrong location.

## 0.44.6

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated parallel tool loading to only loads tools that have a configured version, instead of loading all tools that proto is aware of (like built-in tools). Should see better performance for commands that require loading multiple tools.

## 0.44.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the terminal width isn't available in CI, causing a panic.

## 0.44.2

#### 🚀 Updates

- Changed the "is proto process running?" check during `proto upgrade` to a confirmation prompt, instead of a hard error, allowing you to continue the upgrade if you so wish.
  - Added more logging around the process checks to understand what is going on.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.

## 0.44.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed some minor UI layout issues.

## 0.44.0

This is a unique release that focused primarily on cleaning up our current commands, either by removing arguments, or merging functionality. On top of that, we've refactored all the terminal output using a new UI library powered by [iocraft](https://docs.rs/iocraft/latest/iocraft/). Read the blog post for more information!

#### 💥 Breaking

- Removed the `proto list` and `proto list-remote` commands, use `proto versions` instead.
- Removed the `--global` option from `proto alias`, `unalias`, `pin`, and `unpin`, use `--to` or `--from` instead.
- Removed the `--purge` option from `proto clean`, use `proto uninstall` instead.
- Removed the `--purge-plugins` option from `proto clean`, use `proto clean plugins` instead.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a `--yes` option to `proto outdated`, that skips confirmation prompts.
- Added a `--json` option to `proto clean`, to capture the cleaned result as JSON.
- Added a new command, `proto versions <tool>`, that lists all available remote and installed versions/aliases.
- Added a confirmation prompt to `proto uninstall` flows.
- Updated `proto clean` to accept a target in which to clean as the 1st argument. For example, `proto clean cache`.
- Moved the `--json` and `--yes` options into global options.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `python_tool` to v0.12.2.
  - Switched to `astral-sh/python-build-standalone` from `indygreg/python-build-standalone` for pre-built images.

## 0.43.3

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where an empty globals directory was being skipped instead of being used as a fallback.

## 0.43.2

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the globals directory may not exist for the `pre_run` hook.
- Fixed invalid Nushell syntax generated from `proto activate`.

## 0.43.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed invalid PowerShell syntax generated from `proto activate`.

## 0.43.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a system that allows plugins to require other plugins to be installed, before they will install.
- Added an `--on-init` option to `proto activate`, which will trigger the activation hook immediately in the shell, instead of waiting for a directory/prompt change to occur.
  - If you were manually executing `_proto_hook` before, this will now fail. Please remove!
- Added support for loading `.env` files through the special `env.file` and `tools.*.env.file` settings.
  ```toml
  [env]
  file = ".env"
  ```
- Added support for `~/.netrc` configuration to all HTTP requests.
- Improved implementation of HTTP request/response caching. Now takes into account [HTTP cache semantics](https://github.com/kornelski/rusty-http-cache-semantics).
- Updated `proto install` to multi-install tools in topological order.
- Updated `proto upgrade` to error if there's another process of proto currently running.
- Updated `proto setup` to default to a fallback shell if none could be detected, instead of erroring.
- WASM API
  - Added `ToolMetadataOutput.requires`, allowing the plugin to require other plugins. For example, npm requires node.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed the order of shell profiles/configs when applicable.
- Updated `proto setup` to inherit `PROTO_HOME` if already set, instead of defaulting to `$HOME/.proto`.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `node_depman_tool` to v0.14.1.
  - Added `node` as a required plugin.
- Updated `python_tool` to v0.12.1.

- Updated Rust to v1.83.

## 0.42.2

#### 🚀 Updates

- WASM API
  - Added `ToolMetadataOutput.deprecations`.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `schema_tool` to v0.16.1.
  - Brought back `platform.*.bin-path` to support legacy plugin configs.

## 0.42.1

#### 🚀 Updates

- When installing many tools with `proto install|use`, a failed install for a single tool will no longer abort the install of the other tools.
- Added more logging to debug the "File exists (os error 17)" issue.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed the wrong `proto_version` being passed to WASM function calls.
- When usign the Bash shell, will avoid using `.bash_profile` unless it explicitly exists. This is to support Ubuntu `.profile` setups.

## 0.42.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- Each tool's primary executable file name is no longer based on the plugin's identifier, and is now based on what's configured in the new `LocateExecutablesOutput.exes` setting.
- We've reworked how the `~/.proto/bin` directory works. Instead of only symlinking globally pinned versions (from `~/.proto/.prototools`), we now create a symlink for every tool executable, and every major + minor version installed within that tool. For example, when we install `node`, we may have the following:
  - `~/.proto/bin/node` - Points to the highest installed version.
  - `~/.proto/bin/node-<major>` - Points to the highest version within that major range (`~major`). Is created for each separate major version, for example: `node-20`, `node-22`.
  - `~/.proto/bin/node-<major>.<minor>` - Points to the highest version within that major + minor range (`~major.minor`). Is created for each separate major + minor version, for example: `node-20.1`, `node-22.4`.
  - `~/.proto/bin/node-canary` - Points to a canary install, if it exists.
- WASM API
  - Deprecated `LocateExecutablesOutput.primary` and `LocateExecutablesOutput.secondary` (use `exes` instead).
  - Updated `ToolMetadataOutput.plugin_version` to a `Version` type instead of `String`.

#### 💥 Breaking

- Removed `--global` arg from `proto plugin add|remove`.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added support for JSON and YAML based configurations for non-WASM schema based plugins. This is an alternative to TOML, but supports all the same settings.
- We now cache all text-based HTTP requests made from WASM plugins for 12 hours. This should greatly reduce the overhead cost of making requests, and will help for situations where an internet connection is lost.
- WASM API
  - Added `ExecutableConfig.primary`.
  - Added `LocateExecutablesOutput.exes`.
  - Added `ToolMetadataOutput.minimum_proto_version`.
  - Added `ParseVersionFileInput.path`.

#### 🐞 Fixes

  - Migrated testing APIs to async instead of sync.
  - Deprecated many functions.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a new `--config-mode` (`-c`) global option that controls how configuration are loaded.
  - Supports the following values:
    - `global` - Only load `~/.proto/.prototools`.
    - `local` - Only load `./.prototools` in the current directory.
    - `upwards` (default) - Load `.prototools` while traversing upwards, but do not load `~/.proto/.prototools`.
    - `upwards-global` - Load `.prototools` while traversing upwards, and do load `~/.proto/.prototools`.
  - When not provided, the default mode is dependent on the command being ran.
    - For `activate`, `install`, `outdated`, `status` -> `upwards`
    - Everything else -> `upwards-global`
- Updated `proto install` to show detailed progress bars.
  - Includes downloaded bytes / total bytes stats.
  - Displays the current phase of the install (download, unpack, etc).

- Updated `rust_tool` to v0.11.
- Updated `schema_tool` to v0.15.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- We now provide a plugin for proto itself, so you can now do `proto install proto`. However, this doesn't link bins/shims and is primarily used internally for upgrade/install flows.

## 0.39.7

#### 🚀 Updates

- We rewrote our self-upgrade to account for more edge cases and based its functionality on [other implementations](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/self-replace) in the Rust ecosystem. It should be more reliable moving foward, but if you're on a broken version of proto that can't self-upgrade, reinstall proto entirely to pull the latest version.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a "Failed to copy" or "Text file busy" error when self-upgrading proto.

## 0.39.6

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a potential race condition with the auto-clean that was triggering a file rename/move error.

## 0.39.5

#### 💥 Breaking

- We've discovered a bug with the new "pin proto version" feature that will require non-trivial amount of work to resolve correctly. However, to resolve the bug at this time, the pinning functionality will now only work if you run `proto activate` in your shell.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Improved performance slightly for `proto activate`.
- Improved the logic around cleaning the `~/.proto/tools/proto` directory.
- Updated the `auto-clean` setting to automatically run in more contexts.

## 0.39.4

## 0.39.3

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added `--check` and `--json` options to `proto upgrade`.
- Added an explicit version argument to upgrade/downgrade to for `proto upgrade`.

  - Updated canary to find an applicable release based on the current os/arch combination.
- Updated `node_tool` to v0.11.7.
  - Updated canary to find an applicable release based on the current os/arch combination.

## 0.39.1

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated `proto activate` to set `PROTO_HOME` if it is not defined in the current shell.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed a performance regression on `proto activate`. Should exit immediately now.

## 0.39.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- Updated `proto activate` to not include tools without a configured version and to not include global tools found in `~/.proto/.prototools` by default.
  - If you would like to include global tools, pass `--include-global`.
  - Do be aware that having a lot of global tools will cause considerable performance loss when activation is triggered.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a new setting to `.prototools`, `settings.builtin-plugins`, that can be used to disable all built-in plugins, or only allow a few select plugins.
  - Supports a boolean or list of plugin names.
  - All are enabled by default for backwards compatibility.
- Added `PROTO_NO_MODIFY_PROFILE` and `PROTO_NO_MODIFY_PATH` environment variables to `proto setup` (for automated workflows).
- Updated `proto status` to display and include versions from ecosystem files (`.nvmrc`, etc).
- Updated `github://` plugin locators to support monorepos. Append the project name (that tags are prefixed with) to the path: `github://moonrepo/plugins/node_tool`
- Merged `proto use` and `proto install` commands. If no arguments are provided to `proto install`, it will install all configured tools.
- You can now pin a version of proto itself within `.prototools`, and proto shims will attempt to run proto using that configured version, instead of the global version.
  ```toml
  proto = "0.38.0"
  ```

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `go_tool` to v0.12.

## 0.38.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- While not a direct breaking change, we've added escaping/quoting logic to shell injected values, which was required for the new activation workflow. Please report an issue on GitHub or Discord if the value we injected has incorrect syntax!

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added an experimental command called `proto activate` that can be ran within your shell profile to "activate the proto environment", by setting necessary environment variables and paths when changing directories.
  - Globally installed packages will now be available automatically. This wasn't possible through shims alone.
  - Binaries that come pre-installed with a tool (and are not shims) will also be available automatically.
- Added support for [murex](https://murex.rocks/) shells.
- Added a `--include-global` flag to `proto use`, that will also install globally configured tools.

  - Fixed yarn "2.4.3" not resolving or downloading correctly.
- Updated `python_plugin` to v0.10.2.
  - Will now create a pip shim that includes the major version, for example, `pip3`.

## 0.37.0

#### 💥 Breaking

- WASM API
  - Changed `SyncManifestOutput` `versions` field to the `VersionSpec` type instead of `Version`.
  - Changed `LoadVersionsOutput` `canary`, `latest`, and `aliases` fields to the `UnresolvedVersionSpec` type instead of `Version`.
  - Changed `LoadVersionsOutput` `versions` fields to the `VersionSpec` type instead of `Version`.
  - Renamed `VersionSpec::Version` to `VersionSpec::Semantic`. The inner `Version` must also be wrapped in a `SemVer` type.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added experimental support for the [calver](https://calver.org) (calendar versioning) specification. For example: 2024-04, 2024-06-10, etc.
  - There are some caveats to this approach. Please refer to the documentation.
  - This _should_ be backwards compatible with existing WASM plugins and tools, but in the off chance it is not, please pull in the new PDKs and publish a new release, or create an issue.
- Added a new command, `proto diagnose`, that can be used to diagnose any issues with your current proto installation.
  - Currently diagnoses proto itself, but in the future will also diagnose currently installed tools.
- WASM API

  - This is an experiment to help avoid race conditions where multiple proto processes are all trying to write to the same location.
  - If this results in too large of a performance hit, we'll remove the locking.
- Reworked how serde defaults are applied for input/output plugin function types.

## 0.35.5

    ```toml
    node = "20.10.0"
    [tools.node.aliases]
    work = "^18"
    ```
- Updated `proto alias` and `proto unalias` to longer write to the global config by default. Now requires a `--global` flag.
  - This change was made to align with `proto pin`, `proto tool add`, and `proto tool remove`.

#### 🚀 Updates

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated `proto install-global` and `proto uninstall-global` to detect/resolve a version first, as some package managers require it.
- Updated Windows to _not_ use symlinks for binaries, and instead copy the `.exe` file. This is required to solve "A required privilege is not held by the client" errors, because symlinks require admin privileges.

- Added a `detect-strategy` setting to `~/.proto/config.toml` to configure which strategy to use when detecting a version. Accepts:
  - `first-available` (default) - Will use the first available version that is found. Either from `.prototools` or a tool specific file (`.nvmrc`, etc).
  - `prefer-prototools` - Prefer a `.prototools` version, even if found in a parent directory. If none found, falls back to tool specific file.
- Added support to plugins to ignore certain paths when detecting a version.

  - Binaries (`~/.proto/bin`) and shims (`~/.proto/shims`) now share the same internal data structures.
  - For the most part, is a 1:1 relation. There will be a shim for every binary, and vice versa.
  - Reduced the amount of WASM calls to locate executables to 1 call.
  - Removed the concept of local shims (was a hidden implementation detail).
- Reworked the `proto bin` command.
  - By default returns an absolute path to the real executable (`~/.proto/tools/<tool>/<version>/bin`).
  - Pass `--bin` to return the `~/.proto/bin` path.
  - Pass `--shim` to return the `~/.proto/shims` path.
- Updated `proto clean --purge` and `proto uninstall` to accurately delete all executables.
- Updated `proto uninstall` to support removing the tool entirely (simply omit the version).
- Updated internet connection checks to only check during critical workflows.
  - Will no longer happen if we have a fully-qualified version (primarily for `proto run`).
  - Will still happen for partial versions, as we need to resolve to a fully-qualified.
  - Will always happen for install, upgrade, and other flows that must download files.
- TOML API
  - Added `install.no_bin` and `install.no_shim` fields.

## 0.20.0

#### 💥 Breaking

> To ease the migration process, we've added a new migrate command. Simply run `proto migrate v0.20` after upgrading proto!

- The generated shims have moved to `~/.proto/shims` from `~/.proto/bin`. You'll need to manually update `PATH` in your shell profile if you'd like to continue using the "runtime version detection" functionality.

  ```diff
  export PROTO_HOME="$HOME/.proto"
  -export PATH="$PROTO_HOME/bin:$PATH"
  +export PATH="$PROTO_HOME/shims:$PROTO_HOME/bin:$PATH"
  ```

  Furthermore, we suggest deleting all files in `~/.proto/bin` except for `proto(.exe)`.

- WASM API
  - Removed `env_vars` from `ToolMetadataOutput` and `ToolContext`. Use `host_env!` macro instead.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Reworked the `~/.proto/bin` directory to now contain symlinks to the original tool executables. This is a non-shim based alternative that can be used stand-alone or in unison with our shims.
  - The globally pinned version is the version that's symlinked. This can be updated with `proto install --pin`.
  - This approach _does not_ detect a version at runtime.
- Added a `proto migrate` command for easily applying changes between breaking releases.
- Added support for minisign checksum files. Can now verify `.minisig` signatures for downloaded tools.
- Updated `proto use` to install tools in parallel.
- Updated `proto plugins` and `proto tools` to load plugins in parallel.
- Updated `proto run` to error when the tool attempts to self-upgrade outside of proto.
- TOML API
  - Added a `metadata` setting.
  - Added a `install.checksum-public-key` setting.
- WASM API
  - Added a `self_upgrade_commands` field to `ToolMetadataOutput`.
