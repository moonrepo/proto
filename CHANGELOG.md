## 0.8.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Improved version detection to scan locally installed versions more often, instead of resolving to the latest remote version.
  - This will result in far less "version not installed" errors.
  - Fully-qualified semantic versions are still used as-is.

- When detecting a version and proto encounters a range/requirement using `^`, `~`, `>=`, etc, proto will now resolve the version against the currently installed versions in `~/.proto`, instead of resolving to an arbitray fixed version.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added "bundled" as a supported alias for `npm`.
- Updated `proto local` and `proto global` to support aliases as well as versions.
- Updated `go` to automatically set `GOBIN` in your shell profile if has not been.
