- Added a `proto debug config` command, to debug all loaded configs and the final merged config.
- Added a `PROTO_BYPASS_VERSION_CHECK` environment variable, to bypass loading and checking of versions. Useful when internet is unreliable.

## 0.24.2

## 0.24.0

#### 💥 Breaking

> To ease the migration process, we've added a new migrate command. Simply run `proto migrate v0.24` after upgrading proto!

- Standardized configuration files.
  - Merged `~/.proto/config.toml` functionality into `.prototools` under a new `[settings]` table. This means settings like `auto-clean` can be defined anywhere now.
  - Removed `~/.proto/config.toml`. Use `~/.proto/.prototools` instead, which is now the new global config (via `--global` arg).
  - Moved `node-intercept-globals` setting to `tools.node.intercept-globals`.
- Reworked user configured aliases and default/global version.
  - Moved values to `.prototools` (user managed) from `~/.proto/tools/<name>/manifest.json` (internally managed).
  - Aliases are now stored in the `[tools.<name>]`, while the default version is at the root.
    ```toml
    node = "20.10.0"
    [tools.node.aliases]
    work = "^18"
    ```
- Updated `proto alias` and `proto unalias` to longer write to the global config by default. Now requires a `--global` flag.
  - This change was made to align with `proto pin`, `proto tool add`, and `proto tool remove`.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a `proto migrate v0.24` command for migrating configs. We'll also log a warning if we detect the old configuration.
  - For some scenarios, we'll attempt to auto-migrate under the hood when applicable.
- Added support for defining configuration that can be passed to WASM plugins.
  - Can be added to `.prototools` under a `[tools.<name>]` table.
  - Moved Node.js specific settings into this new format.
    ```toml
    [tools.node]
    bundled-npm = false
    intercept-globals = false
    ```
- Updated non-latest plugins to be cached for 30 days, instead of forever.
- Updated cleaning to also remove old proto versions from `~/.proto/tools/proto`.
- WASM API
  - Added a `get_tool_config` function. Can be typed with a serde compatible struct.
  - Deprecated the `get_proto_user_config` function.

#### 🐞 Fixes

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed `proto upgrade` not working on Linux musl.

## 0.23.7

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Actually fixed `proto use` this time.

## 0.23.6

#### 🚀 Updates

- Enabled wasmtime caching, which should improve performance of WASM plugins by 10-20%.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `proto use` (or parallel processes) would run into file system
  collisions when attempting to download and install multiple TOML schema based tools.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated dependencies.
- Updated parent execution to prefer `proto run <tool>` over `<tool>.exe` on Windows.

## 0.23.5

#### 🚀 Updates

## 0.23.3

#### 🚀 Updates

- Updated `proto install-global` and `proto uninstall-global` to detect/resolve a version first, as some package managers require it.
- Updated Windows to _not_ use symlinks for binaries, and instead copy the `.exe` file. This is required to solve "A required privilege is not held by the client" errors, because symlinks require admin privileges.

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `proto list-global` would panic when canonicalizing paths.
- Fixed multi-version ranges (`||`) not resolving locally installed versions correctly.

## 0.23.2

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where installing a global would fail to find a proto shim on Windows.

## 0.23.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where broken symlinks would fail to be removed. This would result in subsequent "File exists (os error 17)" errors.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Updated Rust to v1.74.
- Updated dependencies.
- Updated logs to now include nanoseconds.

## 0.23.0

#### 💥 Breaking

  - Moved `proto add-plugin` to `proto tool add`.
  - Moved `proto remove-plugin` to `proto tool remove`.
  - Moved `proto plugins` to `proto tool list-plugins`.
  - Moved `proto tools` to `proto tool list`.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a `proto tool info` command for viewing information about a tool and its plugin.
- Added a `detect-strategy` setting to `~/.proto/config.toml` to configure which strategy to use when detecting a version. Accepts:
  - `first-available` (default) - Will use the first available version that is found. Either from `.prototools` or a tool specific file (`.nvmrc`, etc).
  - `prefer-prototools` - Prefer a `.prototools` version, even if found in a parent directory. If none found, falls back to tool specific file.
- Added support to plugins to ignore certain paths when detecting a version.
- Updated Windows to create 3 shim files for each tool: `.cmd` (cmd.exe), `.ps1` (powershell), and no extension (bash).
- WASM API
  - Added `DetectVersionOutput.ignore` field.

#### 🧩 Plugins

- Updated `node_plugin` and `node_depman_plugin` to v0.5.2.
- **Node**

## 0.22.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where `proto clean` or `proto use` (with auto-clean) would crash.

## 0.22.0

#### 🚀 Updates

- Refactored and standardized how executables (bins and shims) are managed.
  - Binaries (`~/.proto/bin`) and shims (`~/.proto/shims`) now share the same internal data structures.
  - For the most part, is a 1:1 relation. There will be a shim for every binary, and vice versa.
  - Reduced the amount of WASM calls to locate executables to 1 call.
  - Removed the concept of local shims (was a hidden implementation detail).
- Reworked the `proto bin` command.
  - By default returns an absolute path to the real executable (`~/.proto/tools/<tool>/<version>/bin`).
  - Pass `--bin` to return the `~/.proto/bin` path.
  - Pass `--shim` to return the `~/.proto/shims` path.
- Updated `proto clean --purge` and `proto uninstall` to accurately delete all executables.
- Updated `proto uninstall` to support removing the tool entirely (simply omit the version).
- Updated internet connection checks to only check during critical workflows.
  - Will no longer happen if we have a fully-qualified version (primarily for `proto run`).
  - Will still happen for partial versions, as we need to resolve to a fully-qualified.
  - Will always happen for install, upgrade, and other flows that must download files.
- TOML API
  - Added `install.no_bin` and `install.no_shim` fields.
- WASM API
  - Added `locate_executables` function.
  - Added `LocateExecutablesInput`, `LocateExecutablesOutput`, `ExecutableConfig` structs.

- Updated `rust_plugin` to v0.4.
- Updated `schema_plugin` (TOML) to v0.5.
- **Node**
  - Updated the `npm` tool to create the `npx` shim instead of the `node` tool.
  - Updated symlinked binaries to use the shell scripts instead of the source `.js` files (when applicable).

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Plugin versions are now pinned and tied to proto releases to avoid unintended drift and API changes.

## 0.21.1

#### 🐞 Fixes

- Fixed an issue where uninstalling the "default version" doesn't delete the symlinked binary.
- Fixed an issue where the versions cache was not being read.
- Fixed an issue where installing a tool would write to the wrong temporary directory.

## 0.21.0

#### 💥 Breaking

  - Removed `input.context` from `LoadVersionsInput` and `ResolveVersionInput`.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added Linux x64 musl support (`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`).
- Improved file and directory locking. Will now work correctly across processes and signals, especially for those killed/dropped.
- Updated WASM functions to use explicit Rust enum types for versions to properly handle all variations (version, alias, requirement, range).
- WASM API
  - Uses `VersionSpec` enum:
    - `ResolveVersionOutput.version`
    - `ToolContext.version`
  - Uses `UnresolvedVersionSpec` enum:
    - `LoadVersionsInput.initial`
    - `ParseVersionFileOutput.version`
    - `ResolveVersionInput.initial`
    - `ResolveVersionOutput.candidate`
    - `SyncManifestOutput.default_version`

## 0.20.0

#### 💥 Breaking

> To ease the migration process, we've added a new migrate command. Simply run `proto migrate v0.20` after upgrading proto!

- The generated shims have moved to `~/.proto/shims` from `~/.proto/bin`. You'll need to manually update `PATH` in your shell profile if you'd like to continue using the "runtime version detection" functionality.

  ```diff
  export PROTO_HOME="$HOME/.proto"
  -export PATH="$PROTO_HOME/bin:$PATH"
  +export PATH="$PROTO_HOME/shims:$PROTO_HOME/bin:$PATH"
  ```

  Furthermore, we suggest deleting all files in `~/.proto/bin` except for `proto(.exe)`.

- WASM API
  - Removed `env_vars` from `ToolMetadataOutput` and `ToolContext`. Use `host_env!` macro instead.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Reworked the `~/.proto/bin` directory to now contain symlinks to the original tool executables. This is a non-shim based alternative that can be used stand-alone or in unison with our shims.
  - The globally pinned version is the version that's symlinked. This can be updated with `proto install --pin`.
  - This approach _does not_ detect a version at runtime.
- Added a `proto migrate` command for easily applying changes between breaking releases.
- Added support for minisign checksum files. Can now verify `.minisig` signatures for downloaded tools.
- Updated `proto use` to install tools in parallel.
- Updated `proto plugins` and `proto tools` to load plugins in parallel.
- Updated `proto run` to error when the tool attempts to self-upgrade outside of proto.
- TOML API
  - Added a `metadata` setting.
  - Added a `install.checksum-public-key` setting.
- WASM API
  - Added a `self_upgrade_commands` field to `ToolMetadataOutput`.
  - Added a `checksum_public_key` field to `DownloadPrebuiltOutput`.
  - Removed `checksum` from `VerifyChecksumInput`.

- Removed `proto local`, use `proto pin` instead.

#### 🚀 Updates

- Added a `proto outdated` command that'll check for new versions of configured tools.
- Added a `proto pin` command, which is a merge of the old `proto global` and `proto local` commands.
- Added a `pin-latest` setting to `~/.proto/config.toml` that'll automatically pin tools when they're being installed with the "latest" version.
- Updated `proto install` to auto-clean stale plugins after a successful installation.

#### ⚙️ Internal

- Added `PROTO_WASM_LOG` environment variable to toggle the logging of messages from Extism and WASM plugins. Useful for debugging.
